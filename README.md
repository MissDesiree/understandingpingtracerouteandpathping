Understanding Ping, Traceroute, and Pathping 

Have you ever had trouble connecting to a website and wondered why? A tool called Ping can help a little but not enough. Let’s say you try to ping a website like networking.com, and it fails. You won’t know where the problem is. The issue could be with:
Your computer
Your home network
Your Internet service provider (ISP)
The website’s network
The server that hosts the website
Ping just says: “I can’t reach the destination.” It does not tell you why it failed. That’s where the traceroute command helps.

Traceroute (the command is just tracert in Windows) is a tool that tracks the path your data takes to reach a destination. It shows each stop (called a hop) along the way.
For example, if you type tracert networking.com, it might go like this:
First, it goes to your default gateway (your home router).
Then it goes to your ISP (like Verizon).
Then it may pass through several servers before reaching the final destination, like Wix, the website host.
If the route stops or shows “Request Timed Out,” it may look like a problem. But sometimes, the device is just blocking ping requests for security reasons. That doesn’t always mean there’s a real issue.
Why Some Sites Don’t Respond
Big companies like Microsoft often block ping or traceroute traffic. So if you try to ping microsoft.com, you may see “Request Timed Out” even if the site is working fine. It’s their choice not to respond to that type of traffic.

Pathping is a more detailed version of traceroute. It has been around since Windows XP, so it’s not new, but it is very useful.
Here’s what happens when you run:
pathping -4 google.com
The -4 tells it to use IPv4 instead of IPv6.
It follows the path to Google, just like traceroute.
Then it sends 100 packets to each hop (each server or device on the path).
It waits and checks how many packets were received.
This helps find packet loss—when some data doesn’t make it through. If 100 packets are sent and only 98 come back, you know there’s a small issue at that hop.

If your company has offices in different cities or countries, and you have connection issues, traceroute and pathping help you find where the break is.
Traceroute = shows the path
Pathping = shows the path + packet loss

Next time a website won’t load, don’t rely only on ping. Use tracert or pathping to dig deeper. These tools are simple but powerful, and they help you become a better troubleshooter. You don’t have to guess anymore you’ll know where the problem really is.
